# Aldroid's Byte Jam config files

These have been pieced together from the Byte Battle config files used by Lovebyte demoparty. PRs and Issues are welcome.

If you want to run a Byte Jam, you probably want to read [./server/README.md](./server/README.md)

Read the readme. Have fun. I love you.
